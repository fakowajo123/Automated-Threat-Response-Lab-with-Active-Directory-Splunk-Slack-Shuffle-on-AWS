# Automated-Threat-Response-Lab-with-Active-Directory-Splunk-Slack-Shuffle-on-AWS

## Introduction

This project showcases my ability to design and deploy secure, automated threat response solutions in cloud environments. I built a hands-on lab simulating enterprise security with Windows Active Directory, Splunk SIEM, and Shuffle SOAR‚Äîall integrated on AWS. The system detects suspicious activity, notifies security via Slack and email, and can automatically isolate compromised devices with human-in-the-loop approval. 

Key skills demonstrated include: AWS cloud infrastructure, Windows domain administration, security telemetry, SIEM/SOAR integration, and incident response automation.

## üß† Key Learnings & Takeaways

### Skills Demonstrated
- AWS cloud & networking
- Windows AD deployment & GPOs
- Splunk SIEM data ingestion & alerting
- SOAR automation with Shuffle & Slack
- Automated and human-approved incident response

### Challenges Faced
- Ensuring reliable log forwarding from Windows to Splunk
- Orchestrating automation without losing human oversight
- Seamless integration between cloud, on-prem, and SaaS tools

### Future Enhancements
- Add MFA/JIT access for critical actions
- More automated playbooks (phishing, privilege escalation, etc.)
- Expand to other SIEM/SOAR platforms and cloud services
