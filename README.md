# Automated-Threat-Response-Lab-with-Active-Directory-Splunk-Slack-Shuffle-on-AWS

## Introduction

Security teams often struggle with slow response times to compromised devices in enterprise environments due to manual alerting and remediation processes. To address this, I designed and deployed a lab that demonstrates an end-to-end automated threat response solution using Active Directory, Splunk, Slack, Shuffle (SOAR), and AWS infrastructure.

The system detects suspicious activity on a managed endpoint, triggers a notification workflow requiring human confirmation, and then automatically isolates the compromised device or user account to prevent further spread‚Äîall in a cloud lab environment.

This project highlights my skills in administering directory services, configuring secure cloud network communications, ingesting and analyzing security telemetry, and building automated workflows for incident response.

## Architecture

This lab leverages AWS to simulate a production-like environment for automated threat response workflows. The core components are:

- **Active Directory Domain Controller** on Windows Server EC2.
- **Windows Test Client** joined to the AD domain.
- **Splunk SIEM** hosted on a dedicated EC2 instance.
- **Shuffle SOAR** for automating incident response and integrations (Shuffle SOAR is deployed as a managed service accessible over the internet, so no AWS EC2 instance is required for SOAR in this architecture).
- **Slack** for real-time alerting and human-in-the-loop confirmation.
- **AWS Security Groups & VPC** for network segmentation and control.

**EC2 Instance Specifications:**

| Component                          | OS/Platform      | Instance Type    | vCPUs | RAM   | Notes                                  |
|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------|-------|----------------------------------------|
| Active Directory Domain Controller  | Windows Server   | t3.xlarge or up  | 4     | 16GB  | Recommended for responsive directory services |
| Windows Test Client                 | Windows 10/11    | t3.large or up   | 2     | 8GB   | For basic domain-joined operations     |
| Splunk Server                       | Ubuntu Server    | t3.xlarge or up  | 4     | 16GB  | Splunk runs on Ubuntu for this lab     |
| **General Note**                    |                  |                  |       |       | Adjust as needed for cost or scale     |

**High-level flow:**
1. Suspicious activity is detected on the Windows client.
2. Logs are forwarded to Splunk for analysis and correlation.
3. Splunk triggers an alert, sending details to Shuffle.
4. Shuffle orchestrates a notification to Slack, requesting human confirmation.
5. Upon approval, Shuffle automates disabling the compromised user account in Active Directory.

## Firewall Setup

- Create a dedicated VPC or use an isolated subnet for the lab.
- Define Security Groups for:
  - Domain Controller (RDP, DNS, AD ports open only to test client and admin IPs).
  - Splunk Server (allow management and forwarder ports).
  - Test Client (limit RDP/WinRM, allow outbound to Splunk and DC).
- Use Network ACLs for extra segmentation.
- Ensure no public IP exposure except for admin access (ideally use VPN or jumpbox).

**[Place Screenshot Here: Security Group Rules/Network ACLs]**

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Active Directory Setup

### Domain Controller Configuration

- Deploy Windows Server EC2 (`t3.xlarge` or higher: 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM).
- Install "Active Directory Domain Services" role.
- Promote server to Domain Controller (e.g., domain: `lab.local`).

**[Place Screenshot Here: AD DS Installation and Promotion Steps]**

### DNS Roles & GPO Policies

- Allow log forwarding to Splunk.

**[Place Screenshot Here: DNS Role Setup/GPO Policy Editor]**

### User Creation in AD & Machine Join

- In Active Directory, create a user account from the AD Users and Computers console. Make this user a member of the "Domain Admins" group so that it has administrative privileges.
- When deploying the Windows Test Client, join it to the `lab.local` domain using this user account.
- Log into the Test Client with the domain user credentials (now with admin rights) so you can install required software and perform administrative tasks on the test machine.

**[Place Screenshot Here: Creating User in AD & Assigning Domain Admin Rights]**

### Joining Test Machine to Domain

- Deploy a Windows EC2 as the test client (`t3.large` or higher: 2 vCPUs, 8GB RAM).
- Set DNS to the DC's private IP.
- Join to `lab.local` domain using the domain admin user you created.
- Test authentication and GPO application.

## üìä Splunk Installation & Configuration

### EC2 Setup for Splunk

- Launch a separate EC2 (Ubuntu Server, `t3.xlarge` or higher: 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM).
- Download Splunk Enterprise from the official Splunk site and install it on Ubuntu. Use sudo as needed.
- To start Splunk for the first time, go to the Splunk installation directory's `bin` folder and run `./splunk start`.
- Set the username and password as prompted.
- Access the Splunk web interface via port 8000 and log in.
- Create a new index in Splunk that will be used for log ingestion from the forwarders.
- For further Splunk usage, users should refer to Splunk documentation and tutorials to learn about configuring searches, alerts, dashboards, and advanced features.

**[Place Screenshot Here: Splunk Installation, Initial Login, and Index Creation]**

### Universal Forwarder on AD & Test Client

- On both the Active Directory Domain Controller and the Windows Test Client, download and install the Splunk Universal Forwarder from the official Splunk website.
- Use the domain admin account to perform the installation so you have the necessary privileges.
- After installation, navigate to the forwarder directory: `C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\system\default`.
- Copy the `inputs.conf` file from the `default` directory to the `local` directory (`C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\system\local`) and edit the copy in the `local` directory.
- Add or modify the following stanza in `inputs.conf` for Windows security logs:
  ```
  [WinEventLog://Security]
  disabled = 0
  index = <your-index-name>
  ```
- Replace `<your-index-name>` with the name of the index you created earlier in Splunk.

### Inputs for AD Logs & Windows Events

- In Splunk, configure data inputs for:
  - Windows Security, Application, System logs.
  - Directory Service logs (on DC).
- Use Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows for parsing and CIM compliance.

**[Place Screenshot Here: Data Inputs Setup in Splunk]**

### Alert Creation

- Create correlation searches in Splunk (e.g., multiple failed logins, privilege escalation).
- Configure alert actions to send events to Shuffle via webhook or app integration.
- For detailed instructions or advanced configurations, users are encouraged to learn more via Splunk's official documentation.

## üîÅ SOAR Integration with Shuffle & Slack

### Setup of Shuffle Playbooks

- In Splunk, under the alert rule‚Äôs webhook action, configure Shuffle as the webhook receiver.
- Shuffle receives the alert and parses the information about what triggered the alert (user, machine, event, etc.).
- This information is then sent from Shuffle to Slack via Shuffle‚Äôs Slack integration.
- Ensure Slack is added as an application to Shuffle and authenticated.

**[Place Screenshot Here: Splunk Alert Webhook to Shuffle]**

**[Place Screenshot Here: Shuffle Playbook Logic/Workflow]**

### Slack Notification Configuration

- Slack receives the alert with the details from Shuffle.
- The notification includes buttons or options for the analyst to approve or deny disabling the user account.
- The user‚Äôs decision (input) is captured by Shuffle for the next step.

**[Place Screenshot Here: Example Slack Alert with Action Buttons]**

### User Input & Automated Account Disable via AD

- If the analyst chooses to disable the user, Shuffle‚Äîusing its Active Directory application and authenticated connection to the domain controller‚Äîissues a command to disable the user account in AD.
- Shuffle then queries the domain controller to confirm the status of the user account (check if it is disabled).

**[Place Screenshot Here: Shuffle AD Action/Confirmation of User Disabled]**

### Confirmation & Final Notification

- Once the user is confirmed as disabled, Shuffle sends a final notification to Slack stating that the user account has been successfully disabled.

## üîê Automated Response Workflow

### Detection > Slack Alert > User Account Disable via AD

- End-to-end flow:
  1. Suspicious event logged and detected.
  2. Splunk triggers alert, sends to Shuffle.
  3. Shuffle notifies Slack and/or email.
  4. Analyst reviews and approves in Slack/email.
  5. Shuffle uses its AD integration to disable the affected user account via the domain controller.
  6. Shuffle confirms the user's account is disabled, then notifies Slack of the result.

## Incident Simulation

- Example scenario:
  - Simulate brute-force attack on test client.
  - Observe detection in Splunk.
  - Confirm alert propagation to Shuffle and Slack.
  - Approve user disablement and verify account is disabled in AD.

- Steps for reproduction:
  1. Generate test event (manual logon failure, PowerShell execution).
  2. Follow alert through pipeline.
  3. Confirm automated response and restoration steps.
